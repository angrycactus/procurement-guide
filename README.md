### What is RFX

RFX stands for “Request for X” where (most often) X is one of Information, Quote or Proposal. RFI, RFQ and RFP documents are formal procurement documents that are issued to the market by a buyer in order to seek information and purchase products and services.

A Request for Information (RFI) is used when you have some idea of what you need but you require more information from vendors in order to subsequently issue a high quality RFQ or RFP. Therefore, an RFI requests as much information as possible from vendors, regarding all aspects of your proposed project.

A Request for Proposal (RFP) is generally a more flexible procurement and is used when you don’t have precisely defined specifications for what you need to purchase. Therefore the RFP encourages input and innovation from vendors in their responses, and can thus create provide you with many different implementation approaches and outcomes for comparison and selection. In one sense, an RFP can be considered an RFI and an RFQ folded into a single document.

A Request for Quote (RFQ) is generally a more constrained procurement and is best used when you already have detailed and precise specifications for what you need to purchase. Therefore, the RFQ focuses on seeking pricing and scheduling information from vendors. Due to its more prescriptive nature, an RFQ will generally discourage vendors from innovating or deviating much from the RFQ specifications.
